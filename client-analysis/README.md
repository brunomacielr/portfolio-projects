## Analysis and Categorization of Customers for a Retailer
This project is an [interactive Power BI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODkwMDU4ZGEtYTRhYi00MTE3LWE4MzktYTk0OGJhZDQ5ZDRiIiwidCI6Ijc3YjdkYTEzLTdiNTgtNGRkMi05MTI4LWEyNzhhMjc4MWRhMCJ9) that can be utilized by a retailer company for client categorization. These categorizations play a crucial role in identifying the company's top clients and assist stakeholders in devising strategies to enhance revenue.

This dashboard was built using the following tools:
- **Excel** (data cleaning and treatment);
- **Power BI** (data visualization).

## Business Questions
- Identify different customer profiles. How would you qualitatively describe the identified profiles?
- Which customer profiles would you recommend the company to prioritize for sales to achieve long-term results with new clients?
- Have the customer loyalty strategies implemented by the company in the "other professional services" sector been effective?

## Answers and Conclusion



The categorization of customers was primarily based on revenue and margin indicators that the customer generates. Customers who generate a high amount of revenue are classified as "Diamond," while those who generate little revenue or even have a negative final margin are labeled as "Bronze."
There are situations that have been observed on a case-by-case basis, such as when a customer brings in significant revenue for the company, but the margin is negative. In these cases, even if the customer does not bring the expected financial return, they are still considered "Diamond" because they are highly valuable to the company since they generate substantial revenue.



Based on indicators such as margin and a calculated metric called PPC (Client Profitability), the conclusion is reached that the most suitable sectors for sales focus would be Government Services, Retail, and Agricultural Services. In all three cases, the average CPC exceeds R$2,000. In the case of Government Services, this indicator even surpasses the value of R$3,000.



The strategies for the "Other Professional Services" sector have been effective, as evidenced by the measures of Lost Clients and Churn. Throughout the year, it is noticeable that the rate of lost clients has been decreasing, with churn shrinking month by month.
