# Portfolio
Hello! In this repository you will find my portfolio of business intelligence dashboards. Some are adapted from in real life demands from previous jobs, others were created for practicing and showcasing specific skills. Inside each folder there is a detailed explanation of the context and purposes of each dashboard.

## Data Analysis Notebooks

### [Analysis of "Actual vs. Budgeted" Cost Center for Departments in an E-commerce](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTVkZmQyMzItNDI2YS00MGNlLTk1OWUtZGFkMjU4YTE0ZWYzIiwidCI6Ijc3YjdkYTEzLTdiNTgtNGRkMi05MTI4LWEyNzhhMjc4MWRhMCJ9)
I used Google’s “Big Query” database to analyze the clickstream data for the Google Merch Store. 

### [Vaccination Public Opinion Analysis]()
My team and I looked at social media data and vaccine preventable disease outbreaks. While we found correlations and significant evidence of a relationship, our model to forecast outbreaks based on social media did not reach a level to be depended on. After our analysis we saw convincing evidence to suggest that social media platforms which took active measure to stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories had an impact on their metrics and would lead to increased vaccination rates.

### [Statistical Analysis of School Vaccination with R](School_Vax_Stats/Vax_Analysis.pdf)
I examined California schools vaccine coverage. With this dataset I could use frequentist technique and Bayesian with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation to establish that private schools had a significantly higher rates of unvaccinated students. I also used a Bayesian approach to identified periods when rates of exceptions to the vaccine requirement increased or decreased. 

### [Using Gradient Boosting to Augment Polling Results](NoteBooks/Gradient_Boosting_With_Polling_Results.ipynb)
I use a script similar to this one to make creat demographic models based on survey results. Gradient Boosting allows me to aggregate weak predictors like individual polls and preform a more accurate classification.

### [Cleaning and Wrangling Messy Data](NoteBooks/LAPD_911_Data_Wrangling.ipynb)
Here I used a variety of techniques to clean an extremely messy data set of emergency call to the LAPD. This a project I'm still working on, with a goal to finding more data on emergency services in Los Angeles.
